# ðŸŒŸ ML From Scratch: A Personal Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository, where I document my journey through the core concepts of machine learning by implementing models and tools from scratch. This serves as both a personal reference and an educational resource for anyone interested in understanding ML from first principles.

## ðŸš€ Current Implementations

### ðŸ”¹ Sequential Neural Network

- **Description:** A basic sequential neural network capable of multiclass classification.
- **Dataset:** Tested on the MNIST dataset using a 3-layer approach, with ReLU as the activation function for hidden layers.
- **Features:** Implements forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent from scratch using only Python and NumPy.

### ðŸ”¹ Transformer-Based Neural Machine Translation

- **Description:** A Transformer model designed for English-to-Spanish translation.
- **Tokenizer:** Utilizes BPE Tokenization with a vocabulary size of 10000.
- **Features:** Implements attention mechanisms and positional encodings to achieve high-quality translations.
